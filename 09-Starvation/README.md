# Starvation In Javascript

In the context of JavaScript, "starvation" typically refers to a situation where one or more tasks or processes do not get a fair share of resources, such as CPU time, due to the dominance of other tasks. This can lead to performance issues and unresponsiveness in your application.

JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it executes one task at a time in a single sequence. If a task takes too long to complete, it can block the execution of other tasks, causing starvation. Here are some common scenarios where starvation can occur in JavaScript:

- **Blocking Code:** If you have long-running synchronous code (code that blocks the event loop), it can cause other tasks to wait, leading to the starvation of other asynchronous tasks. For example, a large computation or a time-consuming synchronous AJAX request can cause this issue.

- **UI Blocking:** When JavaScript is used in the context of a web browser, long-running tasks can block the main thread, causing the UI to become unresponsive. Users may perceive this as starvation because they can't interact with the application.

- **Callback Hell:** Excessive nesting of callbacks, often referred to as "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom," can make code difficult to maintain and understand. It can also lead to inefficient execution, potentially causing certain tasks to starve for resources.
